For this program the problem we are solving here is that a local Radio DJ wants to create a sorted playlist based on the song title name. For the first part we store data. We have to store the data that is provided by the spotify weekly playlists and store them in a binary search tree. For the second part we create a playlist by creating a subset. An example would be subset("Jingle Bells", "Merry Christmas); The techniques that I used for this program was implementing a sorting tree such as a Binary Search Tree so that I can search for songs really quickly. We then transverse this binary tree in our program.
